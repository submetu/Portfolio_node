        p I'm a Web and IoT developer. I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mechatronics. I deal with  robotics, data management, PLC's, and electronics. As far as Web Development is concerned, I have ample amounts of experience in Front-end and Back-end programming. I integrate Web Technologies with electronics to develop automation and IoT systems. I can write industry standard 
          strong
            em responsive web apps using various libraries and frameworks.

        | I got into Web Developing earlier in 2016, however, that makes me an even better candidate for producing modern web apps that use the latest technologies. With a solid understanding of basics, I immediately moved on to using modern frameworks, libraries and coding techniques. I always try to write testable, "easy to reason about" code. All my Web apps focus on cross-browser compatibility, standard-compliance and client-side performance. Regardless of functionality, all of them are fully responsive on all screen sizes including desktop, tablet and mobile screens.

        | Besides the front-end and back-end I've worked with server-side mainly in Node.Js. Node.Js goes well with IoT applications and is also one of the best backend solutions in Web Apps. I've used various npm packages for Node.Js such as Express, Browserify, Mongoose, Sequalize and Forever to name a few. Besides the Front-end and Back-end, I have used Unit Testing tools such as Mocha and Chai. Moreover, task runners and build tools such as Gulp and Grunt.Js were used in some of my projects as well.
